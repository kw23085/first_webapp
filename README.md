# Approach Taken

My approach to this project is to create the wireframe of my website. Once I am done with the wireframe and got a better idea on what I am building I went on and created the Entity Relationship Diagram for my database. Then I went on to write the code in my text editor with constant commits onto github. I also created heroku in my app files in the very beining of my project.
